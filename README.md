# Eventful Restaurant :fork_and_knife:
Here contains an example of a restaurant table service modelled using Event Sourcing.

This means that any state is calculated from a collection of events. In this basic example we do not calculate state,
we merely utilise the power of events to decouple components of the architecture.

In essence we have three actors: Restaurant, Table, Waiter.

Each of these can generate events, whilst also responding to events generated by each other.

## An example
We can create a restaurant, and request that someone delivers food to a specific table:
```java
Restaurant restaurant = new Restaurant(new EventStore(), new Console());
restaurant.deliverTo(new Table(eventStore, "Horrible Customer"));
```

Now a waiter can listen to this event, and respond accordingly:
```java
public class Waiter {

    private EventStore eventStore;
    private Console console;

    public Waiter(EventStore eventStore, Console console) {
        eventStore.listenFor(EventType.SERVICE_REQUESTED, e -> {
            ServiceRequested event = (ServiceRequested) e;
            String description = event.table().description();
            console.println("I hate that customer at " + description + "!!!");
        });
        ...
    }

   ...
}
```
